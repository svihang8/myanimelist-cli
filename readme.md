# MyAnimeList - CLI
This is a fun passion project I made for my love of anime / manga and obsession with managing my list. MyAnimeList is a reliable source for information on anime production and keeping track of your list, however the UI is a significant step down for what is available in the market. Instead of revamping the front end of the code, I made a command line tool to manage my own anime list. You can too, by cloning this repository.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
You will need node.js installed on your local environemnt.
You will need to generate your own API key from myanimelist. Since the API key limits the number of requests, this project will not be hosted.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be
Clone repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/svihang8/myanimelist-cli.git
```
install required dependencies
```
npm i
```
Change the api key and enjoy.

## Deployment
Due to limitation of key requests, this project is not deployed as it can not be scaled.

## Contributing
To contribute, fork this repository and add your own functions. As long as the functionality works, anything goes!
